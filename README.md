# Inception Collage

Inception Collage uses Java's built in graphics libraries, AWT and Swing, to allow users to create picture mosaics using a GUI.

## Features and Function

The GUI of this image processing software allows the user to select one image file as the basis of the mosaic, this is the image that the smaller images will compose. The user then selects any number of other images. These will be overlayed on top of the background image based on their color and composition. With enough of these images, the illusion of the original image appears. When zooming in on the new, large image, however, all of its constituent images are revealed.
